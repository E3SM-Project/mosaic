# Mosaic

`mosaic` provides the functionality to visualize unstructured [MPAS](https://mpas-dev.github.io/)
mesh data on it's native grid within `matplotlib`. Currently MPAS meshes are the
only unstructured meshes used in `E3SM` that `mosaic` supports, but future work
will add support for others.

:::{admonition} Please reach out with any problems!
