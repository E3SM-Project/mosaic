# Mosaic

> ⚠️  **This package in under early development and not ready for production use, yet.**

`mosaic` provides the functionality to visualize unstructured mesh data on it's native grid within `matplotlib`. 
Currently `mosaic` only supports [MPAS](https://mpas-dev.github.io/) meshes, but future work will add support for other unstructured meshes used in `E3SM`.
